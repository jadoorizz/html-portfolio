<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Divyang Ganava, a 2nd-year Electrical Engineering student at NIT Uttarakhand, passionate about
   blending core engineering knowledge with the ever-evolving world of software and web development. I 
   believe in staying curious, learning fast, and adapting to new challenges—whether it’s exploring efficient EV 
   motor designs or building creative web projects. With a CGPA of 7.8 and a growing skill set in programming, 
   I’m working toward building a solid foundation for both technical and problem-solving abilities.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I actively volunteer in the National Service Scheme (NSS), participating in activities like 
  campus cleaning drives, plantation programs, and social awareness campaigns. These experiences have not 
  only strengthened my teamwork skills but also shaped my perspective on social responsibility. I value 
  creativity, collaboration, and using technology for meaningful impact—whether in my projects, my
   community work, or my future career.</p>

<p>I’m currently aiming to expand my expertise in Data Structures & Algorithms and modern web technologies,
   with a long-term goal of securing opportunities at top tech companies like Google. My strengths—fast
    typing, adaptability, and creative thinking—help me learn efficiently and communicate effectively in team 
    environments. I’m driven by a vision to combine my engineering background with software skills to create
     innovative solutions that solve real-world problems.</p>
